<p>Our projects are at the heart of Ottawa Civic Tech. Our projects are how we do civic good. At every event we work on (or during the summer discuss) projects that promote civic good. We lend our individual time and skill to making our society perform better.</p>
<p>Our projects very from the highly social, promoting voter engagement in municiple elections, to the highly technical, improving access to government data that is publicly available but not easily accessed or analyzed.</p>
<p>Projects are choosen organically, anyone can propose a new project at an event and individual people choose which projects they would like to lend their time and talent to.</p>
